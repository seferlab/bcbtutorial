abstract = "Summary The extent to which the three-dimensional organization of the genome contributes to chromosomal translocations is an important question in cancer genomics. We generated a high-resolution Hi-C spatial organization map of the G1-arrested mouse pro-B cell genome and used high-throughput genome-wide translocation sequencing to map translocations from target \{DNA\} double-strand breaks (DSBs) within it. \{RAG\} endonuclease-cleaved antigen-receptor loci are dominant translocation partners for target \{DSBs\} regardless of genomic position, reflecting high-frequency \{DSBs\} at these loci and their colocalization in a fraction of cells. To directly assess spatial proximity contributions, we normalized genomic \{DSBs\} via ionizing radiation. Under these conditions, translocations were highly enriched in cis along single chromosomes containing target \{DSBs\} and within other chromosomes and subchromosomal domains in a manner directly related to pre-existing spatial proximity. By combining two high-throughput genomic methods in a genetically tractable system, we provide a new lens for viewing cancer genomes. "

doi = {10.1093/bioinformatics/btu263}, 
abstract ={Motivation: It has long been hypothesized that incorporating models of network noise as well as edge directions and known pathway information into the representation of protein–protein interaction (PPI) networks might improve their utility for functional inference. However, a simple way to do this has not been obvious. We find that diffusion state distance (DSD), our recent diffusion-based metric for measuring dissimilarity in PPI networks, has natural extensions that incorporate confidence, directions and can even express coherent pathways by calculating DSD on an augmented graph.Results: We define three incremental versions of DSD which we term cDSD, caDSD and capDSD, where the capDSD matrix incorporates confidence, known directed edges, and pathways into the measure of how similar each pair of nodes is according to the structure of the PPI network. We test four popular function prediction methods (majority vote, weighted majority vote, multi-way cut and functional flow) using these different matrices on the Baker’s yeast PPI network in cross-validation. The best performing method is weighted majority vote using capDSD. We then test the performance of our augmented DSD methods on an integrated heterogeneous set of protein association edges from the STRING database. The superior performance of capDSD in this context confirms that treating the pathways as probabilistic units is more powerful than simply incorporating pathway edges independently into the network.Availability: All source code for calculating the confidences, for extracting pathway information from KEGG XML files, and for calculating the cDSD, caDSD and capDSD matrices are available from http://dsd.cs.tufts.edu/capdsdContact: lenore.cowen@tufts.edu or benjamin.hescott@tufts.eduSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

abstract ={Signal flow direction is one of the most important features of the protein-protein interactions in signaling networks. However, almost all the outcomes of current high-throughout techniques for protein-protein interactions mapping are usually supposed to be non-directional. Based on the pairwise interaction domains, here we defined a novel parameter protein interaction directional score and then used it to predict the direction of signal flow between proteins in proteome-wide signaling networks. Using 5-fold cross-validation, our approach obtained a satisfied performance with the accuracy 89.79%, coverage 48.08%, and error ratio 16.91%. As an application, we established an integrated human directional protein interaction network, including 2,237 proteins and 5,530 interactions, and inferred a large amount of novel signaling pathways. Directional protein interaction network was strongly supported by the known signaling pathways literature (with the 87.5% accuracy) and further analyses on the biological annotation, subcellular localization, and network topology property. Thus, this study provided an effective method to define the upstream/downstream relations of interacting protein pairs and a powerful tool to unravel the unknown signaling pathways.},

Our method naturally weights and combines into reliable predictions genomic features only weakly associated with interaction (e.g., messenger RNAcoexpression, coessentiality, and colocalization). In addition to de novo predictions, it can integrate often noisy, experimental interaction data sets. We observe that at given levels of sensitivity, our predictions are more accurate than the existing high-throughput experimental data sets. We validate our predictions with TAP (tandem affinity purification) tagging experiments. Our analysis, which gives a comprehensive view of yeast interactions, is available at genecensus.org/intint.},

abstract ={Hepatocyte nuclear factors (HNFs) are a heterogeneous class of evolutionarily conserved transcription factors that are required for cellular differentiation and metabolism. Mutations in HNF-1αand HNF-4α genes impair insulin secretion and cause type 2 diabetes. Regulation of HNF-4/HNF-1 expression byHNF-3α and HNF-3β was studied in embryoid bodies in which one or both HNF-3α or HNF-3βalleles were inactivated. HNF-3β positively regulated the expression of HNF-4α/HNF-1α and their downstream targets, implicating a role in diabetes. HNF-3β was also necessary for expression of HNF-3α. In contrast, HNF-3α acts as a negative regulator of HNF-4α/HNF-1α demonstrating thatHNF-3α and HNF-3β have antagonistic transcriptional regulatory functions in vivo. HNF-3α does not appear to act as a classic biochemical repressor but rather exerts its negative effect by competing for HNF-3 binding sites with the more efficient activatorHNF-3β. In addition, the HNF-3α/HNF-3β ratio is modulated by the presence of insulin, providing evidence that the HNF network may have important roles in mediating the action of insulin.},

@article{cancerbarabasi,
    abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Metastasis patterns in cancer vary both spatially and temporally. Network modelling may allow the incorporation of the temporal dimension in the analysis of these patterns. {METHODS}: We used Medicare claims of 2,265,167 elderly patients aged > or = 65 years to study the large-scale clinical pattern of metastases. We introduce the concept of a cancer metastasis network, in which nodes represent the primary cancer site and the sites of subsequent metastases, connected by links that measure the strength of co-occurrence. {RESULTS}: These cancer metastasis networks capture both temporal and subtle relational information, the dynamics of which differ between cancer types. Using these networks as entities on which the metastatic disease of individual patients may evolve, we show that they may be used, for certain cancer types, to make retrograde predictions of a primary cancer type given a sequence of metastases, as well as anterograde predictions of future sites of metastasis. {CONCLUSION}: Improvements over traditional techniques show that such a network-based modelling approach may be suitable for studying metastasis patterns.},

                The analysis and interpretation of relationships between biological molecules, networks and concepts is becoming a major bottleneck in systems biology. Very often the pure amount of data and their heterogeneity provides a challenge for the visualization of the data. There are a wide variety of graph representations available, which most often map the data on {2D} graphs to visualize biological interactions. These methods are applicable to a wide range of problems, nevertheless many of them reach a limit in terms of user friendliness when thousands of nodes and connections have to be analyzed and visualized. In this study we are reviewing visualization tools that are currently available for visualization of biological networks mainly invented in the latest past years. We comment on the functionality, the limitations and the specific strengths of these tools, and how these tools could be further developed in the direction of data integration and information sharing.

Although applicable to any system of molecular components and interactions, Cytoscape is most powerful when used in conjunction with large databases of protein-protein, protein-DNA, and genetic interactions that are increasingly available for humans and model organisms. Cytoscape's software Core provides basic functionality to layout and query the network; to visually integrate the network with expression profiles, phenotypes, and other molecular states; and to link the network to databases of functional annotations. The Core is extensible through a straightforward plug-in architecture, allowing rapid development of additional computational analyses and features. Several case studies of Cytoscape plug-ins are surveyed, including a search for interaction pathways correlating with changes in gene expression, a study of protein complexes involved in cellular recovery to DNA damage, inference of a combined physical/functional interaction network for Halobacterium, and an interface to detailed stochastic/kinetic gene regulatory models.},

  abstract = {Only recently did mankind realize that it resides on a world of networks. The Internet and the World Wide Web are changing our life. Our physical existence is based on various biological networks. We have recently learned that the term ""network"" turns out to be a central notion in our time, and the onsequent explosion of interest in networks is a social and cultural phenomenon. The principles of the complex organization and evolution of networks, natural and artificial are the topic of this book, which is written by physicists and is addressed to all involved researchers and students. The aim of the text is to understand networks and the basic principles of their structural organization and evolution. The ideas are presneted in a clear and pedegogical way, with minimal mathematics, so even students without a deep knowledge of mathematics and statistical physics will be able to rely on this as a reference. Special attention is given to real networks, both natural and artificial. Collected empirical data and numerous real applications of existing theories are discussed in detail, as well as the topical problems of communication networks.},

  abstract = {This book reviews and discusses methods for the analysis of social networks with a focus on applications of these  methods to many substantive examples. As the first book to provide comprehensive coverage of the methodology and applications of the field, it is both a reference book and a textbook. Social network analysis is used widely in the social and behavioral sciences, as well as in economics, marketing, and industrial engineering. The social network perspective focuses on relationships among social entities and is an important addition to standard social and behavioral research, which is primarily concerned with attributes of the social units. Social Network Analysis: Methods and Applications reviews and discusses methods for the analysis of social networks with a focus on applications of these methods to many substantive examples. It is a reference book that can be used by those who want a comprehensive review of network methods, or by researchers who have gathered network data and want to find the most appropriate method by which to analyze it. It is also intended for use as a textbook as it is the first book to provide comprehensive coverage of the methodology and applications of the field. },

It is shown that in such a setting the area represents the probability that a randomly chosen diseased subject is (correctly) rated or ranked with greater suspicion than a randomly chosen non-diseased subject. Moreover, this probability of a correct ranking is the same quantity that is estimated by the already well-studied nonparametric Wilcoxon statistic. These two relationships are exploited to (a) provide rapid closed-form expressions for the approximate magnitude of the sampling variability, i.e., standard error that one uses to accompany the area under a smoothed ROC curve, (b) guide in determining the size of the sample required to provide a sufficiently reliable estimate of this area, and (c) determine how large sample sizes should be to ensure that one can statistically detect differences in the accuracy of diagnostic techniques.},

Proteins of known function and cellular location tend to cluster together, with 63\% of the interactions occurring between proteins with a common functional assignment and 76\% occurring between proteins found in the same subcellular compartment. Possible functions can be assigned to a protein based on the known functions of its interacting partners. This approach correctly predicts a functional category for 72\% of the 1,393 characterized proteins with at least one partner of known function, and has been applied to predict functions for 364 previously uncharacterized proteins.},

Our method naturally weights and combines into reliable predictions genomic features only weakly associated with interaction (e.g., messenger RNAcoexpression, coessentiality, and colocalization). In addition to de novo predictions, it can integrate often noisy, experimental interaction data sets. We observe that at given levels of sensitivity, our predictions are more accurate than the existing high-throughput experimental data sets. We validate our predictions with TAP (tandem affinity purification) tagging experiments.

Starting with a subset of metazoan-specific proteins, more than 4000 interactions were identified from high-throughput, yeast two-hybrid (HT=Y2H) screens. Independent coaffinity purification assays experimentally validated the overall quality of this Y2H data set. Together with already described Y2H interactions and interologs predicted in silico, the current version of the Worm Interactome (WI5) map contains [~]5500 interactions. Topological and biological features of this interactome network, as well as its integration with phenome and transcriptome data sets, lead to numerous biological hypotheses.

    abstract = {The recent abundance of genome sequence data has brought an urgent need for systematic proteomics to decipher the encoded protein networks that dictate cellular function. To date, generation of large-scale protein-protein interaction maps has relied on the yeast two-hybrid system, which detects binary interactions through activation of reporter gene expression. With the advent of ultrasensitive mass spectrometric protein identification methods, it is feasible to identify directly protein complexes on a proteome-wide scale. Here we report, using the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a test case, an example of this approach, which we term high-throughput mass spectrometric protein complex identification (HMS-PCI). Beginning with 10\% of predicted yeast proteins as baits, we detected 3,617 associated proteins covering 25\% of the yeast proteome. Numerous protein complexes were identified, including many new interactions in various signalling pathways and in the DNA damage response. Comparison of the HMS-PCI data set with interactions reported in the literature revealed an average threefold higher success rate in detection of known complexes compared with large-scale two-hybrid studies. Given the high degree of connectivity observed in this study, even partial HMS-PCI coverage of complex proteomes, including that of humans, should allow comprehensive identification of cellular networks.},

The identification and analysis of their components provides insight into how the ensemble of expressed proteins (proteome) is organized into functional units. We used tandem-affinity purification (TAP) and mass spectrometry in a large-scale approach to characterize multiprotein complexes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We processed 1,739 genes, including 1,143 human orthologues of relevance to human biology, and purified 589 protein assemblies. Bioinformatic analysis of these assemblies defined 232 distinct multiprotein complexes and proposed new cellular roles for 344 proteins, including 231 proteins with no previous functional annotation. Comparison of yeast and human complexes showed that conservation across species extends from single proteins to their molecular environment. Our analysis provides an outline of the eukaryotic proteome as a network of protein complexes at a level of organization beyond binary interactions. This higher-order map contains fundamental biological information and offers the context for a more reasoned and informed approach to drug discovery.},

abstract ={We explored genomic expression patterns in the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae responding to diverse environmental transitions. DNA microarrays were used to measure changes in transcript levels over time for almost every yeast gene, as cells responded to temperature shocks, hydrogen peroxide, the superoxide-generating drug menadione, the sulfhydryl-oxidizing agent diamide, the disulfide-reducing agent dithiothreitol, hyper- and hypo-osmotic shock, amino acid starvation, nitrogen source depletion, and progression into stationary phase. A large set of genes (∼ 900) showed a similar drastic response to almost all of these environmental changes. Additional features of the genomic responses were specialized for specific conditions. Promoter analysis and subsequent characterization of the responses of mutant strains implicated the transcription factors Yap1p, as well as Msn2p and Msn4p, in mediating specific features of the transcriptional response, while the identification of novel sequence elements provided clues to novel regulators. Physiological themes in the genomic responses to specific environmental stresses provided insights into the effects of those stresses on the cell.},

    abstract = {Drosophila melanogaster is a proven model system for many aspects of human biology. Here we present a two-hybrid-based protein-interaction map of the fly proteome. A total of 10,623 predicted transcripts were isolated and screened against standard and normalized complementary DNA libraries to produce a draft map of 7048 proteins and 20,405 interactions. A computational method of rating two-hybrid interaction confidence was developed to refine this draft map to a higher confidence map of 4679 proteins and 4780 interactions. Statistical modeling of the network showed two levels of organization: a short-range organization, presumably corresponding to multiprotein complexes, and a more global organization, presumably corresponding to intercomplex connections. The network recapitulated known pathways, extended pathways, and uncovered previously unknown pathway components. This map serves as a starting point for a systems biology modeling of multicellular organisms, including humans. 10.1126/science.1090289},

In this paper the theoretical properties of a class of processes with particular reference to the point spectrum or corresponding covariance density functions are discussed. A particular result is a self-exciting process with the same second-order properties as a certain doubly stochastic process. These are not distinguishable by methods of data analysis based on these properties.},

and explore the effectiveness of 3 categories of features: content-based, network-based, and microblog-speciﬁc memes for correctly identifying rumors. Moreover, we show how these features are also effective in identifying disinformers, users who endorse a rumor and further help it to spread. We perform our experiments on more than 10,000 manually annotated tweets collected from Twitter and show how our retrieval model achieves more than 0.95 in Mean Average Precision ({MAP}). Finally, we believe that our dataset is the first large-scale dataset on rumor detection. It can open new dimensions in analyzing online misinformation and other aspects of microblog conversations.},

abstract = {In this paper, we study the problem of rooting out a single rumor source: supposing that a rumor, which originates from one node among a set of suspect nodes in a network, is spreading across the network following the susceptible-infected (SI) model, how can we and how well can we identify this rumor source? With the a priori knowledge of the set of suspect nodes and a snapshot observation of infected nodes, we construct a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator to identify the rumor source. For regular tree-type networks, we establish exact and asymptotic results on the detection probability of the source estimator. In particular, if the network is not linear, we have the following asymptotic results of the correct detection probability: First, when every infected node belongs to the suspect set, it grows from 0.25 to 0.307 as the node degree increases from three to infinity, a result first established in [1], [2] via a different approach. Second, when the suspect nodes form a connected subgraph of the network, it significantly exceeds the a priori probability, and reliable detection is achieved as the node degree becomes large. Third, when there are only two suspect nodes, it is at least 0.75 and increases with the distance between the two nodes. Our analysis leverages ideas from the Polya's urn model and sheds insight into the behavior of the rumor spreading process.},

We provide a procedure to identify multiple sources of an outbreak or their closer neighbors. Our methodology is based on a simple spectral technique requiring only the knowledge of the undirected contact graph. The algorithm is tested on a variety of graphs collected from outbreaks including fluency, H5N1, Tbc, in urban and rural areas. Results show that the spectral technique is able to identify the source nodes if the graph approximates a tree sufficiently.},

abstract = {Identifying the infection sources in a network, including the individuals who started a rumor in a social network, the computers that introduce a virus into a computer network, or the index cases of a contagious disease, plays a critical role in limiting the damage caused by the infection through timely quarantine of the sources. We consider the problem of estimating the infection sources and the infection regions (subsets of nodes infected by each source) in a network, based only on knowledge of the underlying network connections, and when the number of sources is unknown a priori. We derive estimators for the infection sources and their infection regions based on approximations of the infection sequences counts. We prove that if there are at most two infection sources in a geometric tree, our estimator identifies the true source or sources with probability going to one as the number of infected nodes increases. When there are more than two infection sources, and when the maximum possible number of infection sources is known, we propose an algorithm with quadratic complexity to estimate the actual number and identities of the infection sources. Simulations are conducted on various kinds of networks, including tree networks, small-world networks and real world power grid networks, to verify the performance of our algorithms. Our simulation results show that with high probability, our proposed estimators are within a few hops from the true infection sources.},

@article{Zhu2012,
abstract = {This paper studies the problem of detecting the information source in a network in which the spread of information follows the popular Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model. We assume all nodes in the network are in the susceptible state initially except the information source which is in the infected state. Susceptible nodes may then be infected by infected nodes, and infected nodes may recover and will not be infected again after recovery. Given a snapshot of the network, from which we know all infected nodes but cannot distinguish susceptible nodes and recovered nodes, the problem is to find the information source based on the snapshot and the network topology. We develop a sample path based approach where the estimator of the information source is chosen to be the root node associated with the sample path that most likely leads to the observed snapshot. We prove for infinite-trees, the estimator is a node that minimizes the maximum distance to the infected nodes. A reverse-infection algorithm is proposed to find such an estimator in general graphs. We prove that for \$g\$-regular trees such that \$gq>1,\$ where \$g\$ is the node degree and \$q\$ is the infection probability, the estimator is within a constant distance from the actual source with a high probability, independent of the number of infected nodes and the time the snapshot is taken. Our simulation results show that for tree networks, the estimator produced by the reverse-infection algorithm is closer to the actual source than the one identified by the closeness centrality heuristic. We then further evaluate the performance of the reverse infection algorithm on several real world networks.},

    abstract = {A representation and interpretation of the area under a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve obtained by the "rating" method, or by mathematical predictions based on patient characteristics, is presented. It is shown that in such a setting the area represents the probability that a randomly chosen diseased subject is (correctly) rated or ranked with greater suspicion than a randomly chosen non-diseased subject. Moreover, this probability of a correct ranking is the same quantity that is estimated by the already well-studied nonparametric Wilcoxon statistic. These two relationships are exploited to (a) provide rapid closed-form expressions for the approximate magnitude of the sampling variability, i.e., standard error that one uses to accompany the area under a smoothed ROC curve, (b) guide in determining the size of the sample required to provide a sufficiently reliable estimate of this area, and (c) determine how large sample sizes should be to ensure that one can statistically detect differences in the accuracy of diagnostic techniques.},

doi = {10.1093/bioinformatics/btg036}, 
abstract ={Motivation: The human genome project has led to the
discovery of many human protein coding genes which were
previously unknown. As a large fraction of these are
functionally uncharacterized, it is of interest to develop
methods for predicting their molecular function from sequence.Results: We have developed a method for prediction of
protein function for a subset of classes from the Gene Ontology
classification scheme. This subset includes several
pharmaceutically interesting categories‚Äîtranscription
factors, receptors, ion channels, stress and immune response
proteins, hormones and growth factors can all be predicted.
Although the method relies on protein sequences as the sole
input, it does not rely on sequence similarity, but instead on
sequence derived protein features such as predicted post
translational modifications (PTMs), protein sorting signals and
physical/chemical properties calculated from the amino acid
composition. This allows for prediction of the function for
orphan proteins where no homologs can be found. Using this
method we propose two novel receptors in the human genome, and
further demonstrate chromosomal clustering of related proteins.Availability: Sequences can be submitted to the
prediction server via a web interface at http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/ProtFun/Contact: ljj@cbs.dtu.dk

abstract ={Motivation: There is a growing interest in improving the cluster analysis of expression data by incorporating into it prior knowledge, such as the Gene Ontology (GO) annotations of genes, in order to improve the biological relevance of the clusters that are subjected to subsequent scrutiny. The structure of the GO is another source of background knowledge that can be exploited through the use of semantic similarity.Results: We propose here a novel algorithm that integrates semantic similarities (derived from the ontology structure) into the procedure of deriving clusters from the dendrogram constructed during expression-based hierarchical clustering. Our approach can handle the multiple annotations, from different levels of the GO hierarchy, which most genes have. Moreover, it treats annotated and unannotated genes in a uniform manner. Consequently, the clusters obtained by our algorithm are characterized by significantly enriched annotations. In both cross-validation tests and when using an external index such as protein‚Äìprotein interactions, our algorithm performs better than previous approaches. When applied to human cancer expression data, our algorithm identifies, among others, clusters of genes related to immune response and glucose metabolism. These clusters are also supported by protein‚Äìprotein interaction data.Contact: dotna@cs.bgu.ac.ilSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

ABSTRACT = {BACKGROUND:Gene Ontology (GO) is a standard vocabulary of functional terms and allows for coherent annotation of gene products. These annotations provide a basis for new methods that compare gene products regarding their molecular function and biological role.RESULTS:We present a new method for comparing sets of GO terms and for assessing the functional similarity of gene products. The method relies on two semantic similarity measures; simRel and funSim. One measure (simRel) is applied in the comparison of the biological processes found in different groups of organisms. The other measure (funSim) is used to find functionally related gene products within the same or between different genomes. Results indicate that the method, in addition to being in good agreement with established sequence similarity approaches, also provides a means for the identification of functionally related proteins independent of evolutionary relationships. The method is also applied to estimating functional similarity between all proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and to visualizing the molecular function space of yeast in a map of the functional space. A similar approach is used to visualize the functional relationships between protein families.CONCLUSION:The approach enables the comparison of the underlying molecular biology of different taxonomic groups and provides a new comparative genomics tool identifying functionally related gene products independent of homology. The proposed map of the functional space provides a new global view on the functional relationships between gene products or protein families.},

    abstract = {Functional prediction of open reading frames coded in the genome is one of the most important tasks in yeast genomics. Among a number of large-scale experiments for assigning certain functional classes to proteins, experiments determining protein-protein interaction are especially important because interacting proteins usually have the same function. Thus, it seems possible to predict the function of a protein when the function of its interacting partner is known. However, in vitro experiments often suffer from artifacts and a protein can often have multiple binding partners with different functions. We developed an objective prediction method that can systematically include the information of indirect interaction. Our method can predict the subcellular localization, the cellular role and the biochemical function of yeast proteins with accuracies of 72.7\%, 63.6\% and 52.7\%, respectively. The prediction accuracy rises for proteins with more than three binding partners and thus we present the open prediction results for 16 such proteins.},

Our method naturally weights and combines into reliable predictions genomic features only weakly associated with interaction (e.g., messenger RNAcoexpression, coessentiality, and colocalization). In addition to de novo predictions, it can integrate often noisy, experimental interaction data sets. We observe that at given levels of sensitivity, our predictions are more accurate than the existing high-throughput experimental data sets. We validate our predictions with TAP (tandem affinity purification) tagging experiments.

abstract ={Protein–protein interactions play crucial roles in the execution
 of various biological functions. Accordingly, their comprehensive
 description would contribute considerably to the functional
 interpretation of fully sequenced genomes, which are flooded with novel
 genes of unpredictable functions. We previously developed a system to
 examine two-hybrid interactions in all possible combinations between
 the ≈6,000 proteins of the budding yeast Saccharomyces
 cerevisiae. Here we have completed the comprehensive analysis
 using this system to identify 4,549 two-hybrid interactions among 3,278
 proteins. Unexpectedly, these data do not largely overlap with those
 obtained by the other project [Uetz, P., et al. (2000)
 Nature (London) 403, 623–627] and hence have
 substantially expanded our knowledge on the protein interaction space
 or interactome of the yeast. Cumulative connection of these binary
 interactions generates a single huge network linking the vast majority
 of the proteins. Bioinformatics-aided selection of biologically
 relevant interactions highlights various intriguing subnetworks. They
 include, for instance, the one that had successfully foreseen the
 involvement of a novel protein in spindle pole body function as well as
 the one that may uncover a hitherto unidentified multiprotein complex
 potentially participating in the process of vesicular transport. Our
 data would thus significantly expand and improve the protein
 interaction map for the exploration of genome functions that eventually
 leads to thorough understanding of the cell as a molecular system.},

Starting with a subset of metazoan-specific proteins, more than 4000 interactions were identified from high-throughput, yeast two-hybrid (HT=Y2H) screens. Independent coaffinity purification assays experimentally validated the overall quality of this Y2H data set. Together with already described Y2H interactions and interologs predicted in silico, the current version of the Worm Interactome (WI5) map contains [~]5500 interactions. Topological and biological features of this interactome network, as well as its integration with phenome and transcriptome data sets, lead to numerous biological hypotheses.

    abstract = {Drosophila melanogaster is a proven model system for many aspects of human biology. Here we present a two-hybrid-based protein-interaction map of the fly proteome. A total of 10,623 predicted transcripts were isolated and screened against standard and normalized complementary DNA libraries to produce a draft map of 7048 proteins and 20,405 interactions. A computational method of rating two-hybrid interaction confidence was developed to refine this draft map to a higher confidence map of 4679 proteins and 4780 interactions. Statistical modeling of the network showed two levels of organization: a short-range organization, presumably corresponding to multiprotein complexes, and a more global organization, presumably corresponding to intercomplex connections. The network recapitulated known pathways, extended pathways, and uncovered previously unknown pathway components. This map serves as a starting point for a systems biology modeling of multicellular organisms, including humans. 10.1126/science.1090289},

information) on a network of people. Identifying rumors is crucial in online social media where large amounts of information are easily spread across a large network by sources with unverified authority. In this paper, we address the problem of rumor detection in microblogs
and explore the effectiveness of 3 categories of features: content-based, network-based, and microblog-speciﬁc memes for correctly identifying rumors. Moreover, we show how these features are also effective in identifying disinformers, users who endorse a rumor and further help it to spread. We perform our experiments on more than 10,000 manually annotated tweets collected from Twitter and show how our retrieval model achieves more than 0.95 in Mean Average Precision ({MAP}). Finally, we believe that our dataset is the first large-scale dataset on rumor detection. It can open new dimensions in analyzing online misinformation and other aspects of microblog conversations.},

abstract = {In this paper, we study the problem of rooting out a single rumor source: supposing that a rumor, which originates from one node among a set of suspect nodes in a network, is spreading across the network following the susceptible-infected (SI) model, how can we and how well can we identify this rumor source? With the a priori knowledge of the set of suspect nodes and a snapshot observation of infected nodes, we construct a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator to identify the rumor source. For regular tree-type networks, we establish exact and asymptotic results on the detection probability of the source estimator. In particular, if the network is not linear, we have the following asymptotic results of the correct detection probability: First, when every infected node belongs to the suspect set, it grows from 0.25 to 0.307 as the node degree increases from three to infinity, a result first established in [1], [2] via a different approach. Second, when the suspect nodes form a connected subgraph of the network, it significantly exceeds the a priori probability, and reliable detection is achieved as the node degree becomes large. Third, when there are only two suspect nodes, it is at least 0.75 and increases with the distance between the two nodes. Our analysis leverages ideas from the Polya's urn model and sheds insight into the behavior of the rumor spreading process.},

abstract = {The epidemic spreading of a disease can be described by a contact network whose nodes are persons or centers of contagion and links heterogeneous relations among them. We provide a procedure to identify multiple sources of an outbreak or their closer neighbors. Our methodology is based on a simple spectral technique requiring only the knowledge of the undirected contact graph. The algorithm is tested on a variety of graphs collected from outbreaks including fluency, H5N1, Tbc, in urban and rural areas. Results show that the spectral technique is able to identify the source nodes if the graph approximates a tree sufficiently.},

abstract = {Identifying the infection sources in a network, including the individuals who started a rumor in a social network, the computers that introduce a virus into a computer network, or the index cases of a contagious disease, plays a critical role in limiting the damage caused by the infection through timely quarantine of the sources. We consider the problem of estimating the infection sources and the infection regions (subsets of nodes infected by each source) in a network, based only on knowledge of the underlying network connections, and when the number of sources is unknown a priori. We derive estimators for the infection sources and their infection regions based on approximations of the infection sequences counts. We prove that if there are at most two infection sources in a geometric tree, our estimator identifies the true source or sources with probability going to one as the number of infected nodes increases. When there are more than two infection sources, and when the maximum possible number of infection sources is known, we propose an algorithm with quadratic complexity to estimate the actual number and identities of the infection sources. Simulations are conducted on various kinds of networks, including tree networks, small-world networks and real world power grid networks, to verify the performance of our algorithms. Our simulation results show that with high probability, our proposed estimators are within a few hops from the true infection sources.},

abstract = {This paper studies the problem of detecting the information source in a network in which the spread of information follows the popular Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model. We assume all nodes in the network are in the susceptible state initially except the information source which is in the infected state. Susceptible nodes may then be infected by infected nodes, and infected nodes may recover and will not be infected again after recovery. Given a snapshot of the network, from which we know all infected nodes but cannot distinguish susceptible nodes and recovered nodes, the problem is to find the information source based on the snapshot and the network topology. We develop a sample path based approach where the estimator of the information source is chosen to be the root node associated with the sample path that most likely leads to the observed snapshot. We prove for infinite-trees, the estimator is a node that minimizes the maximum distance to the infected nodes. A reverse-infection algorithm is proposed to find such an estimator in general graphs. We prove that for \$g\$-regular trees such that \$gq>1,\$ where \$g\$ is the node degree and \$q\$ is the infection probability, the estimator is within a constant distance from the actual source with a high probability, independent of the number of infected nodes and the time the snapshot is taken. Our simulation results show that for tree networks, the estimator produced by the reverse-infection algorithm is closer to the actual source than the one identified by the closeness centrality heuristic. We then further evaluate the performance of the reverse infection algorithm on several real world networks.},

year = {2012}, 
doi = {10.1093/nar/gks1029}, 
abstract ={The 3D higher order organization of chromatin within the nucleus of eukaryotic cells has so far remained elusive. A wealth of relevant information, however, is increasingly becoming available from chromosome conformation capture (3C) and related experimental techniques, which measure the probabilities of contact between large numbers of genomic sites in fixed cells. Such contact probabilities (CPs) can in principle be used to deduce the 3D spatial organization of chromatin. Here, we propose a computational method to recover an ensemble of chromatin conformations consistent with a set of given CPs. Compared with existing alternatives, this method does not require conversion of CPs to mean spatial distances. Instead, we estimate CPs by simulating a physically realistic, bead-chain polymer model of the 30-nm chromatin fiber. We then use an approach from adaptive filter theory to iteratively adjust the parameters of this polymer model until the estimated CPs match the given CPs. We have validated this method against reference data sets obtained from simulations of test systems with up to 45 beads and 4 loops. With additional testing against experiments and with further algorithmic refinements, our approach could become a valuable tool for researchers examining the higher order organization of chromatin.},

abstract ={Chromosomes are not positioned randomly within a nucleus, but instead, they adopt preferred spatial conformations to facilitate necessary long-range gene–gene interactions and regulations. Thus, obtaining the 3D shape of chromosomes of a genome is critical for understanding how the genome folds, functions and how its genes interact and are regulated. Here, we describe a method to reconstruct preferred 3D structures of individual chromosomes of the human genome from chromosomal contact data generated by the Hi-C chromosome conformation capturing technique. A novel parameterized objective function was designed for modeling chromosome structures, which was optimized by a gradient descent method to generate chromosomal structural models that could satisfy as many intra-chromosomal contacts as possible. We applied the objective function and the corresponding optimization method to two Hi-C chromosomal data sets of both a healthy and a cancerous human B-cell to construct 3D models of individual chromosomes at resolutions of 1 MB and 200 KB, respectively. The parameters used with the method were calibrated according to an independent fluorescence in situ hybridization experimental data. The structural models generated by our method could satisfy a high percentage of contacts (pairs of loci in interaction) and non-contacts (pairs of loci not in interaction) and were compatible with the known two-compartment organization of human chromatin structures. Furthermore, structural models generated at different resolutions and from randomly permuted data sets were consistent.},

We generated a high-resolution Hi-C spatial organization map of the G1-arrested mouse pro-B cell genome and used high-throughput genome-wide translocation sequencing to map translocations from target \{DNA\} double-strand breaks (DSBs) within it. \{RAG\} endonuclease-cleaved antigen-receptor loci are dominant translocation partners for target \{DSBs\} regardless of genomic position, reflecting high-frequency \{DSBs\} at these loci and their colocalization in a fraction of cells. To directly assess spatial proximity contributions, we normalized genomic \{DSBs\} via ionizing radiation. Under these conditions, translocations were highly enriched in cis along single chromosomes containing target \{DSBs\} and within other chromosomes and subchromosomal domains in a manner directly related to pre-existing spatial proximity. By combining two high-throughput genomic methods in a genetically tractable system, we provide a new lens for viewing cancer genomes. "

localization of specific nucleic acids sequences in native context, is a
20-year-old technology that has developed continuously. Over its maturation,
various methodologies and modifications have been introduced to optimize the
detection of DNA and RNA. The pervasiveness of this technique is largely
because of its wide variety of applications and the relative ease of
implementation and performance of in situ studies. Although the basic
principles of FISH have remained unchanged, high-sensitivity detection,
simultaneous assay of multiple species, and automated data collection and
analysis have advanced the field significantly. The introduction of FISH
surpassed previously available technology to become a foremost biological
assay. Key methodological advances have allowed facile preparation of
low-noise hybridization probes, and technological breakthroughs now permit
multi-target visualization and quantitative analysis - both factors that have
made FISH accessible to all and applicable to any investigation of nucleic
acids. In the future, this technique is likely to have significant further
impact on live-cell imaging and on medical diagnostics.},

Here, we combined chromatin organization analysis by chromosome conformation capture-carbon copy, computational modeling and epigenomics to achieve the first integrated view, through time, of a connection between chromatin state and its architecture. We used this approach to examine the chromatin dynamics of the HoxA cluster in a human myeloid leukemia cell line at various stages of differentiation. We found that cellular differentiation involves a transient activation of the 5′-end HoxA genes coinciding with a loss of contacts throughout the cluster, and by specific silencing at the 3′-end with H3K27 methylation. The 3D modeling of the data revealed an extensive reorganization of the cluster between the two previously reported topologically associated domains in differentiated cells. Our results support a model whereby silencing by polycomb group proteins and reconfiguration of CTCF interactions at a topologically associated domain boundary participate in changing the HoxA cluster topology, which compartmentalizes the genes following differentiation.},

Conventional modeling methods only focus on the bias among different chromatin regions within the same experiment but neglect the bias arising from different experimental sequencing depth. We now show that the regional interaction bias is tightly coupled with the sequencing depth, and we further identify a chromatin structure parameter as the inherent characteristics of Hi-C derived data for chromatin regions. Then we present an approach for chromatin structure prediction capable of relaxing both kinds of sequencing biases by using this identified parameter. This method is validated by intra and inter cell-line comparisons among various chromatin regions for four human cell-lines (K562, GM12878, IMR90 and H1hESC), which shows that the openness of chromatin region is well correlated with chromatin function. This method has been executed by an automatic pipeline (AutoChrom3D) and thus can be conveniently used.},

To reflect this important progress, we have integrated CTCF-binding sites with genomic topological domains defined using Hi-C data.

Generation of a matrix of interaction frequencies between sites on the same or different chromosomes reveals their relative spatial disposition and provides information about the physical properties of the chromatin fiber. This methodology can be applied to the spatial organization of entire genomes in organisms from bacteria to human. Using the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we could confirm known qualitative features of chromosome organization within the nucleus and dynamic changes in that organization during meiosis. We also analyzed yeast chromosome III at the G1stage of the cell cycle. We found that chromatin is highly flexible throughout. Furthermore, functionally distinct AT- and GC-rich domains were found to exhibit different conformations, and a population-average 3D model of chromosome III could be determined. Chromosome III emerges as a contorted ring.},

  abstract={The spatial organization of the genome is intimately linked to its biological function, yet our understanding of higher order genomic structure is coarse, fragmented and incomplete. In the nucleus of eukaryotic cells, interphase chromosomes occupy distinct chromosome territories, and numerous models have been proposed for how chromosomes fold within chromosome territories. These models, however, provide only few mechanistic details about the relationship between higher order chromatin structure and genome function. Recent advances in genomic technologies have led to rapid advances in the study of three-dimensional genome organization. In particular, Hi-C has been introduced as a method for identifying higher order chromatin interactions genome wide. Here we investigate the three-dimensional organization of the human and mouse genomes in embryonic stem cells and terminally differentiated cell types at unprecedented resolution. We identify large, megabase-sized local chromatin interaction domains, which we term /`topological domains/', as a pervasive structural feature of the genome organization. These domains correlate with regions of the genome that constrain the spread of heterochromatin. The domains are stable across different cell types and highly conserved across species, indicating that topological domains are an inherent property of mammalian genomes. Finally, we find that the boundaries of topological domains are enriched for the insulator binding protein CTCF, housekeeping genes, transfer RNAs and short interspersed element (SINE) retrotransposons, indicating that these factors may have a role in establishing the topological domain structure of the genome.},

@book{geoalgos2006,
    abstract = {{This book develops geometric techniques for proving the polynomial time solvability of problems in convexity theory, geometry, and - in particular - combinatorial optimization. It offers a unifying approach based on two fundamental geometric algorithms: - the ellipsoid method for finding a point in a convex set and - the basis reduction method for point lattices. The ellipsoid method was used by Khachiyan to show the polynomial time solvability of linear programming. The basis reduction method yields a polynomial time procedure for certain diophantine approximation problems. A combination of these techniques makes it possible to show the polynomial time solvability of many questions concerning poyhedra - for instance, of linear programming problems having possibly exponentially many inequalities. Utilizing results from polyhedral combinatorics, it provides short proofs of the poynomial time solvability of many combinatiorial optimization problems. For a number of these problems, the geometric algorithms discussed in this book are the only techniques known to derive polynomial time solvability. This book is a continuation and extension of previous research of the authors for which they received the Fulkerson Prize, awarded by the Mathematical Programming Society and the American Mathematical Society.}},
